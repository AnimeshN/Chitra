Chitra - Data analytics for health policy

Chitra helps health workers record robust data and view aggregated community health profiles. With this information, they can not only improve health by carrying out relevant interventions, but are also empowered to hold the local government clinic and authorities responsible for poor health. Thus, Chitra provides a sustainable and empowering solution.
